This project is for analyzing tempreture from 1995 to 2020.

**What the project is about?**

The main objective of this project is to analayzie the temperature of different countries and determine which country is effected most because of temperature change.The description of the dataset given below is taken from directly from kaggle:

Global warming is the ongoing rise of the average temperature of the Earth's climate system and has been demonstrated by direct temperature measurements and by measurements of various effects of the warming - Wikipedia.
So a dataset on the temperature of major cities of the world will help analyze the same. Also weather information is helpful for a lot of data science tasks like sales forecasting, logistics etc.
Thanks to University of Dayton, the dataset is available as separate txt files for each city here. The data is available for research and non-commercial purposes only.. Please refer to this page for license.

**What is the task?**

The task is to analyze and determine how much temperature has incresed in different parts of the world and which cities are seeing a rapid increase in temperature.

**What actions did I took?**

To analyze the the problem I had to tackle some problems mainly cleaning the data set.I visualized the data set for analyzing and determining.The actions are well described and demonstrated in the codes.

**Code:**

 * Temperature_Data_Analyzing_and_Visualization: 
 
      - Taking data from source
      - Setting up the enviroment for coding
      - Finding values which needs to be changed or cleaned
      - Renaming values for better understanding
      - Visualizing different columns to understand the relation between them and the temperature
      - Analyzing and determining which countries are facing rapid temperature increase
     
**Resutlts and take-home information**

From the analyzation we got that in Mongolia,Kazakhstan,Norway,Australia,Ukraine temperature has increased a lot from 1995 to 2020 due to global warming.I also realised that using barplot result more clear visualization than using scatterplot.

**What could be done in the future?**

* Predicting temperature using region name, country name and month name
* Separating all countrys according to year for better visualization
* Using different plots like boxplot,regplot etc.
